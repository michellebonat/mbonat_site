				%strong Project Description
			%p Trained from scratch a model that can distinguish dogs from cats by looking at images.

			%h3
				%strong How It Works
			%p Images are taken in from an existing dataset on Kaggle. These images are then put into 3 sets: test, training, and validation. Using the pre-trained VGG16 model, it is first run, and then fine tuned.
			%h3
				%strong Contribution
			%p Built on my own as a personal project.
