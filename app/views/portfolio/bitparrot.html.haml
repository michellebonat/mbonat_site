				%strong Project Description
			%p This is a newer project, I am still building it out. This application was created because I found myself spending too much time tracking information about coding-related things I needed to be on top of (meetups, blogs, tweets, and things like that). I also wanted to find information specific to my city, without wading through lots of information ... and I also like building apps in Ruby on Rails. So rather than manually tracking all of this nefarious info I created an app to do it for me.


			%h3
				%strong How It Works
			%p The application parses data from various APIs behind the scenes and transforms that into ways a user can easily consume it.
			%h3
				%strong Contribution
			%p Built on my own as a personal project.
